This code ramdomly generates the brick wall with the point cloud data in curves, assume the boxes are the bricks.
The boxes are generated by the cubic interpolation model, and the curve is generated by the random points in the xz plane.
The curve is duplicated with the points and translate with the y and z direction as the n+1 layer which overlay the n layer with for loop.
Draw the boxes with the vertices and edges of mesh, then save all boxes into one .obj file in the assign folder.
